# nga-tautohetohe

This script scrapes HTML text from the Hansard report webpages using BeautifulSoup4.

hansard_scraper.py relies on taumahi.py which must be either located in the same directory or installed in your system as a python library.

Run hansard_scraper.py with Python3 and watch as it downloads and extracts all te reo paragraphs from the HTML of the Hansard web pages and saves the information to csv files.
